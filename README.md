# weAId - Smart Healthcare Waiting System

Ever waited hours at a hospital just because you arrived later than someone with a minor issue? We built weAId to solve this frustrating problem that affects millions of patients daily.

weAId is a medical triage and queue management platform that rethinks the traditional "first come, first served" approach. Using AI to evaluate symptom severity, we ensure patients with urgent needs get seen faster, while giving everyone realistic wait time estimates.

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional hospital waiting systems are inefficient and sometimes dangerous:
- Patients with urgent conditions might wait too long
- People have no idea how long they'll be waiting
- Medical staff lack tools to prioritize effectively
- Communication between patients and providers is limited

## Key Features

- **Smart Triage**: Our AI analyzes symptoms to assign priority levels - no more waiting based solely on arrival time!
- **Real-time Updates**: See your place in line and how long until you're seen
- **Hospital Dashboard**: Gives medical staff the big picture with AI insights to manage resources
- **Patient Portal**: Easy way to message your doctor or the hospital
- **Emergency Button**: One-tap access to emergency services when seconds count

## Tech Stack

We built weAId using:
- React.js with React Router for a smooth single-page experience
- CSS Modules for component-specific styling
- Custom color theming with CSS variables
- React Icons (Font Awesome) for consistent visuals
- Context API with hooks for state management
- Mobile-first responsive design (it works great on phones!)
